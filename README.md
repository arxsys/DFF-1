DFF 2: 
------

DFF 2 is a new version of DFF. It include ArxSys dff-pro enhancement and modules.

The goal is to have a fresh project that can be compiled easily on lastest linux distro, is stable and documented. 

For that the first step is to port DFF GUI to PyQt5, make the compilation tool use the lastest version of dependencies, and document the API. 

Once the main goal will be achieved, DFF 2 could replace DFF and new features could be added to the project.
