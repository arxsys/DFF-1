DFF 2 : 
=======

DFF 2 is a new version of DFF. It include ArxSys dff-pro enhancement and modules.
The goal is to have a fresh project that can be compiled easily on lastest linux distro, stable and documented. 
Currently the project is still difficult to compile with all the dependencies so we provide a working docker image !
